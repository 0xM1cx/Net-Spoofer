# Network Spoofing Script

## Overview

This Python script provides a basic framework for performing network spoofing techniques including ARP spoofing. It allows you to manipulate network traffic by spoofing various network elements such as IP addresses and MAC addresses.
### Features

1. ARP Spoofing: Spoof ARP packets between a victim and a router.
2. DNS Spoofing (Coming Soon): Spoof DNS responses to redirect traffic.
3. MAC Address Spoofing (Coming Soon): Spoof MAC addresses of network devices.
4. IP Address Spoofing (Coming Soon): Spoof IP addresses in network packets.

## Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Required Python packages (scapy, colorama)
